# Makefile for testing code by comparing test output with sample output
# For heavy

# Tests only su3_static_mr and su3_sum (not su3_hev_cg)  CD 12/06/97

# Example: 
#    make check

# For comparing test output with sample output

# Instructions...
# 1.  Select the appropriate job launch command below.
# 2.  There should already be sample output files constructed from
#     code that you trust.
# 3.  Run the command
#        make -f Make_test test

# Change to suit...
